# AI-Based Procedural Content Generation (PCG)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of AI to procedurally generate game levels and assets. The system leverages **GANs** for realistic content generation and **reinforcement learning** to optimize the difficulty of levels.

## Features
- Procedural generation of 2D/3D game levels.
- AI integration for generating content based on player preferences.
- Real-time level adjustment using dynamic difficulty algorithms.
- Built with [Unity](https://unity.com/) for game development, and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) for AI models.

## Project Structure
- `assets/`: Contains textures and models used in the game.
- `models/`: AI models trained for content generation.
- `src/`: Core source code for the procedural generation system and AI integration.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/AI-Game-PCG.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the project in Unity and run the PCG scripts to generate levels.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for 3D content generation.
- Improve the AI model to better adapt to player feedback.
